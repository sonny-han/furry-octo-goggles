                <h1>Central Park Runs</h1>
                <p>I regularly go on runs that go through Central Park in Manhattan. Each image above is a SVG of the path that I took during a run that went through the park, gathered from my GPS watch, exported as a .gtx file, then visualized as an .svg file. With the background of Manhattan and Central Park removed, the geometries are interesting in that they overlap a lot in certain segments and not so much in others. With a hundred of these historical entries, it would be intriguing to both see them side by side, sort them by distance, sort them by similarities (not sure how!?), and overlap them all. </p>

                <h1>Spam Texts</h1>
                <p>Ever since September of 2021, I have been receiving an absurd amount of spam text messages  that range from union elections, insurance quotes, far-right propagandas, and just simply absurd messages. I think the catalog would be a fitting way to display the absurdity of the messages as well as the amount of messages I have been getting since someone sold my phone number to whatever list it is on. I would be able to sort them by who is sending them (Teamster Women, Quote Wizard, anonymous sender, Trump campaign, “Lena,” Pence campaign), what they call me (Greg, Douglas... but mainly Greg), political leanings?, to name a few. </p>

                <h1>Wordle</h1>
                <p>I have been playing Wordle and sharing my results with my friends. It would be interesting to see if I can sort them by how successful I was for each game by the amount of tries, I can sort them by the amount of yellows or greens, or if you could arrange each day’s results into a kind of a mosaic, given the gridded form. </p>
